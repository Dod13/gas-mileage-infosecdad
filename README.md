# GitHub Repo for Gas mileage project

Develop a program that will accept user input for miles driven and number of gallons used for each tankful. You will need to allow for decimal input for gallons and miles.

When the user enters both, you should print the miles-per-gallon (mpg) for that tankful, and increment the total miles and gallons used.When the user finishes, calculate and print out the total number of miles and gallons collected and the overall mpg.

Example Program Output (bold is user input):

Enter gallons used (-1 to end): 19.5
Enter miles driven: 400
The MPG for this tank was: 20.512820

Enter gallons used (-1 to end): 17.3
Enter miles driven: 340
The MPG for this tank was: 19.653179

Enter gallons used (-1 to end): -1

Total amount of fuel: 36.8 gallons
Total distance driven: 740 miles
Overall MPG: 20.108695
*******************************************
You will need to open a new window in VS Code and run `git clone` with the new repository.
Create a `.txt` file with your pseudo code.
Create a `.c` file for your code and get to work.
Make sure you get your code into GitHub via `Stage all Changes` -> `Commit staged changes` -> `Push`
Submission to Github should include the following:
* `README.md` file with the pseudo code that shows your logic
* `.c` file with the source code
* compiled code (.exe or .out)
